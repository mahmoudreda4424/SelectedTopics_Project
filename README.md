# Realistic Soil Quality Assessment System 🌱

## Project Overview
This project is designed to **assess soil quality for crop cultivation using real soil data**. It evaluates the suitability of soil based on multiple factors such as soil texture, pH, nutrient availability (NPK), and organic carbon content. The system also provides **region-specific feedback for Egypt**.

The goal is to help farmers, agronomists, and researchers make informed decisions about soil management and crop planning.

## Features
- ✅ Evaluate soil texture (sand, clay, and soil organic carbon)  
- ✅ Assess pH suitability for specific crops  
- ✅ Calculate nutrient adequacy for Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K)  
- ✅ Adjust scores based on Egypt-specific standards and conditions  
- ✅ Provide region-specific feedback based on latitude  
- ✅ Output detailed soil quality report including overall score and sub-scores

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**  
- Realistic soil data (simulated or API-based)  
- Modular functions for soil assessment  
- Dictionary-based configuration for crop parameters
